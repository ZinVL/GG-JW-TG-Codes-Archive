# GG-JW-TG-Codes-Archive
An archive/dump for dinosaur, building, and decoration codes while also serving as a hub for public knowledge on how to edit the game. 

Legal Notice, I do not endorse nor support the modding of Jurassic World The Game as if done incorrectly could result in your account being banned. None of these methods or codes are mine and I have no association with those who mod the game. This repo serves as a safe archive for information so that is easier for those who mod.
