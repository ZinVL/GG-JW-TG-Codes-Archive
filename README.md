- An archive/dump for dinosaur, building, and decoration codes while also serving as a hub for public knowledge on how to edit the game.


  *Legal Notice, I do not endorse nor support the modding of Jurassic World The Game as if done incorrectly could result in your account being banned. None of these methods or codes are mine and I have no association with those who mod the game. This repo serves as a safe archive for information so that is easier for those who mod.*

Dinosaur safety/Prevention of a ban
Users often report that when using a unreleased dinosaur code and obtaining said dinosaur, they are then swiftly banned and wiped from the game. While there isn't much to do against stopping a ban (or being unbanned) we can prevent being banned by using 'safe' codes on dinosaurs we know have been released. To check if a dinosaur has been released first, you should check 'JWTG Toolbox,' a site run by the community thats reliable and up-to date. This link will lead you to the creature page sorted by newest dinosaurs, HOWEVER, before trying a dinosaurs code make sure to click on the dinosaur in question at the link, check its release date, and ensure its in the game. (https://www.paleo.gg/games/jurassic-world-the-game/creatures?sort=release_date) 

**The following below is a dinosaur not yet in the game which you can conclude by the "TBD" (To be decided) mark on the 'Release Date:' row.**
